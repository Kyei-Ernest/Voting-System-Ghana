Overview of Files
__init__.py: This file initializes the Voting_system package.
age_calc.py: Contains functionality to calculate age based on a given date of birth.
ballot_creation.py: Handles the creation of ballots for the voting system.
mysql_delete.py: Provides functionality to delete records from a MySQL database.
mysql_value_checker.py: Checks values in a MySQL database.
prov_Ghcard_details.py: Handles provisional Ghana card details (possibly for voter identification).
Registration.py: Manages voter registration processes.
results_processing.py: Processes and tabulates voting results.
schema.py: Defines the database(MySQL) schema for the voting system.
voting.py: Contains the main logic for the voting process.

NB:All these files are connected to a MYsql database(Which means you will need a MYsql database to run these files successsfully).
   First of all make sure to setup your your database(MYsql) and run the schema.py file in order to create the database needed for the voting system.
# Steps
* Run schema.py to create the database structure required for the voting system( note that the database name you use
  must be used across all the other modules) 
* Execute the "start_other_registration()" function [register the presidential_candidate,the constituencies and the member_of_parliament(take note of the 
  order stated and do same)]. After you can execute the "start_voter_registration()" function to register voters.
* User can then cast votes using the voting module
